# bovine-assembly

Currently under active development. This repo contains pipelines designed to assembly, validate, and compare bovine assemblies for multiple sequencing technologies and assembler strategies.

## Purpose
Can assemble given data into genomes and then validate quality

## Usage
modify parameters in `snakepit/run_parameters.yaml` and run as `snakemake`. More details and linking to the [LSF](https://github.com/AnimalGenomicsETH/snakemake_lsf) profile coming soon.
